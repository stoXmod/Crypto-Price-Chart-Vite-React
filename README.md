This is a Vite + React and dependencies fixed version of the original project. The original project was created with Create React App and had some dependencies issues. I fixed them and now it works with Vite + React.

Thanks to the original author for the project. The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/ayepRahman/react-crypto-tracker).

For this project, used below technologies,

- reactjs with typescript (Vite + React)
- visx for visualization
- styled-component for styling
- coingecko api
- material-ui for ui components.
- and other libraries.

# Getting Started with Vite + React

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
